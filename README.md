# KY frontend Assignment 1
## To-do:
* You need to create a carousel/ image gallery either from scratch or you can use [this as a template.](https://github.com/yashrajbharti/Pixi-displacement-carousal)
* The carousal must have a good animation effect, previous and next buttons, a different text displayed at the bottom of each slide.
* You can also create a horizontal scroll instead of previous and next buttons, so when the user is scrolling vertically, the image gallery scrolls horizontally. (Example the second section of [this website](https://www.cyberpunk.net/in/en/)).
* It will be a great addition if the slides of carousal automatically move every 5 seconds.
* Create three sections each of 100vh (100% of the screen height), and this carousel/image gallery goes to the **second section of your webpage**.
* Feel free to use swiper.js if you want; just make sure your **custom animation** is appealing (a glitch effect will be nicer, but feel free to animate it the way you want).
* Take inspiration from sources like dribbble, youtube, or even codepen, but try to create your own work, so you learn something from it.
* Once started with the work, fill essential details in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cRPZsjbYsvZxjy9LjtxH4Fq09hDLtHeXVc8w3B2ZGNE/edit?usp=sharing), and submit your work on time, as I'll begin checking your code right after the deadline has reached, so you must not make any commits after submission time.

## How to submit
* Fork this repo.
* Clone it to your local, use any IDE of your choice and, 
* Add/create the files you want with the **optimized size images** (use any online image size optimizer) and begin with your code.
* Commit your changes and push your code by making a pull request.
* Deploy your code on Github pages, netlify, or any other web hosting solution.
* You must complete this task before 1st December at 1 pm IST.
* Judging criteria will be your custom animation, bug-free, optimized code, with no commits made after the deadline has reached. The work's uniqueness will also be appreciated; feel free to add a custom scrollbar, custom cursor, preloader, etc, to stand out from others.
  
## Scoring
* The task has a total of 100 points. Completion of all the listed points in to-do gives you a maximum of 80 points.
* The remaining 20 points comes from your added extra features.
* The best code will be merged to this repo and top 8 (or lesser) pull request will move to the next round.
* Try to give your best shot, make sure the website looks lively and not static with your animation effects.
